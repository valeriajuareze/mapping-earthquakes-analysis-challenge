# Mapping Earthquakes and Tectonic Plates

## Purpose of the Project

Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and finally, they would like to see the data on a third map (dark mode).
